#+title: Bucks library README
#+author: Me, who else?

* What is even going on here?

Bucks is a new and shiny money handling library. I made it, because we have five
different 'Money' type implementations and they are all slightly different from
each other. Therefore, making a new one and pulling the best parts of those old
makes a whole lot more sense!

* But how do I use it?

Add 'bucks' to your .cabal file and maybe to your stack.yaml as well. You're a
big boy, you know the drill.

* Features

Things that require chonky third-party dependencies are hidden behind flags.
Want aeson instances? Enable the flag. Want Rel8 for your database shenanigans?
Enable the flag! Want something else? Add that thing, make a flag for it, and
don't forget to have fun!

* You forgot feature X..

And you're welcome to add it :)
